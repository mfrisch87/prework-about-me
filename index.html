      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am working as a Senior Application Support Specialist at a local print  and marketing company. I am interested in a more technical role in the tech industry or possibly even the Sports industry possibly.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born and raised in Washington all of my life.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>One of my favorite things to do in my down time is to cook or bake. I am constantly trying new recipes and styles of cooking and trying to hone my abilities. I have a pipe dream of potentially opening a restaurant some day.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My real dream job, though not tech related, would to work in the front office of a professional sports team. I have a strong passion for sports and have always dreamt of being a part of the day to day operations.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am currently living in Renton, Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Besides sports, I have always had a strong passion and interest in technology and the indsutry itself. I am currently feeling stuck / bored in my current position at work and would like to make improvements to my skill set and hopefully change my career.</p>
